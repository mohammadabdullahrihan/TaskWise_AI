## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#64B5F6), evoking focus and clarity.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), providing a gentle and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted green (#A5D6A7), offering a subtle, refreshing visual cue for task completion and success.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and neutral look. It works well for both headlines and body text, ensuring readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent task statuses and actions (e.g., a checkmark for completed, a clock for pending, an edit pencil). Icons should be consistent and easily understandable.
- Implement a clean and organized layout, with clear sections for tasks, subtasks, and due dates. Prioritize easy navigation and a clutter-free interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user experience. For example, use a smooth transition when marking a task as complete or when new subtasks are suggested. Avoid distracting or unnecessary animations.
